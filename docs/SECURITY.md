# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines security policies and procedures for the Social Auto Workflows platform, ensuring protection of sensitive data, brand assets, and maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security@grayghost.dev with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours and provide updates every 72 hours.

## Security Architecture

### Data Classification

| Level | Description | Examples | Controls |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Critical | PII, credentials, keys | API keys, user data, passwords | Encryption, access logging, rotation |
| Sensitive | Brand assets, internal data | Logos, strategy docs, analytics | Access control, audit trails |
| Internal | Non-public information | Workflows, configurations | Role-based access |
| Public | Publicly available | Documentation, open data | Standard controls |

### Encryption

#### At Rest
- Database: AES-256 encryption
- File storage: Server-side encryption (SSE-S3)
- Secrets: Kubernetes sealed secrets
- Backups: Encrypted with separate keys

#### In Transit
- All APIs: TLS 1.3 minimum
- Internal services: mTLS
- Webhook endpoints: HTTPS only
- Database connections: SSL required

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Service Authentication
```yaml
# n8n workflow authentication
credentials:
  - type: oauth2
    scopes: ['read:workflows', 'write:content']
  - type: apiKey
    rotation: 90days
```

#### User Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required
- SSO integration via SAML/OIDC
- Session timeout: 12 hours
- Password policy: 14+ chars, complexity required

### Access Control

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role | Permissions | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| Admin | Full system access | System administrators |
| Editor | Create/edit workflows | Content managers |
| Viewer | Read-only access | Stakeholders |
| Operator | Execute workflows | Automation systems |

#### Principle of Least Privilege
- Default deny for all resources
- Explicit grants required
- Regular access reviews (quarterly)
- Automated deprovisioning

## Compliance Requirements

### PII Protection

#### Detection
Automated scanning for PII patterns:
- Social Security Numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Personal identifiers
- Email addresses (contextual)

#### Prevention
```javascript
// PII scanning middleware
const piiPatterns = [
  /\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b/, // SSN
  /\b\d{4}[\s-]?\d{4}[\s-]?\d{4}[\s-]?\d{4}\b/, // Credit card
  // Additional patterns...
];

function scanForPII(content) {
  return piiPatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(content));
}
```

### Brand Compliance

#### Asset Protection
- Watermarking for brand images
- Access logging for brand assets
- Version control with approval workflow
- Usage tracking and reporting

#### Automated Checks
```yaml
# Brand compliance workflow
- Check color compliance: #FF0000 (approved red)
- Validate logo usage: minimum size 100px
- Verify trademark text: Â® symbol required
```

### Regulatory Compliance

- **GDPR**: Data minimization, right to deletion
- **CCPA**: Consumer data protection
- **SOC 2**: Annual audits
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

## Security Controls

### Infrastructure Security

#### Network Security
```hcl
# Example security group
resource "aws_security_group" "n8n" {
  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/8"]  # Internal only
  }
  
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

#### Container Security
- Base images scanned daily
- No root containers
- Read-only filesystems where possible
- Security policies enforced via admission controllers

### Application Security

#### Input Validation
All inputs validated against:
- Type constraints
- Length limits
- Pattern matching
- Injection prevention

#### Output Encoding
- HTML encoding for web output
- JSON escaping for API responses
- SQL parameterization for queries

### Monitoring & Logging

#### Security Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Unusual data access patterns
- API rate limit violations

#### Audit Logging
Required fields:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "user": "user@example.com",
  "action": "workflow.execute",
  "resource": "workflow-123",
  "result": "success",
  "ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "session": "sess-abc123"
}
```

## Incident Response

### Incident Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Critical | Active breach, data exposure | 15 minutes | Credentials leaked |
| High | Potential breach, vulnerabilities | 1 hour | Unpatched CVE |
| Medium | Security weaknesses | 4 hours | Missing MFA |
| Low | Best practice violations | 24 hours | Weak passwords |

### Response Procedures

1. **Detect & Alert**
   - Automated detection via SIEM
   - Manual reporting channels
   - 24/7 monitoring

2. **Contain**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Block malicious IPs

3. **Investigate**

5. **Recover**
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Verify system integrity
   - Resume normal operations

6. **Learn**
   - Post-incident review
   - Update procedures
