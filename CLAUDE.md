# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a social media content creation automation project. The codebase is currently in initial setup phase.

## Development Environment

- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (based on .idea directory and automation.iml file)
- Working Directory: `/Users/grayghostdataconsultants/Social_Media/Content_Creation/automation`

## Project Structure

As this is a new project, the structure will evolve as features are implemented. When adding new features:
- Consider organizing code by functionality (e.g., content generation, scheduling, platform integrations)
- Follow the established patterns once the initial architecture is in place

## Notes
